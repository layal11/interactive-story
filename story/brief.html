        <h1 class="title">A Lebanese Story</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            A Lebanese father awoke one day, concerned about his son's future. Despite having graduated, 
            his son is still unemployed. Lebanon's unemployment rate is high, and young people in general struggle to
            find work in order to build a better future for themselves.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, in traditional Arab society, particularly in Lebanon, adults frequently reside  in their
            parentsâ€™ house until they are married or ready to have children of their own. As a result, parental guidance
            extends beyond the age of 18 (the typical Western age of independence), and parents may still have an influence
            on their children's decisions, particularly those concerning marriage.
            <br><br>
            keeping in mind the Lebanon's economic crisis, young people are unable to consider marriage due to their 
            inability to purchase a home or even start a family. And it is the father's responsibility to think clearly 
            and creatively in order to assist his son.
            <br><br>
            The father is astute and decided to make his son to marry a girl of his choice. Moreover, he has his own 
            strategies for achieving his goal. Let's see how the father intends to make things work as he desires.
